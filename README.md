# Opencv_Rubiks_Cube_Solver
Augmented reality based Rubik's Cube solver. 


The following tools uses opencv along with rubik_sover library (created by Victor Cabezas) to solve a scrmbled 3X3 rubik's cube of any color. The basic techniques used is coler detecrion using mask, optimizations and kociemba algorithm to solve the cube.
